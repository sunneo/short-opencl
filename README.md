this github is used for shorten opencl program.
the idea is to make it as simple as it can, so that user does not have to 
concern about the underlying platforms and devices. 

In this project, I make the api similiar to the CUDA runtime.
what the next to do is build a source-to-source translator based on open64,
so that user can use it to develop opencl program easier.
